# REPL

This is an example of using the `usePythonConsole` hook to render an interactive console.

:::caution
At this time, interrupting execution waits until the lastest command has finished running. This prevents runaway processes from being cancelled.

You can find the source code for this example [here](https://github.com/elilambnz/react-py/blob/main/website/src/components/Console.tsx).
